## Week 1
  - What is HTML?
    - **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage
    - Made up of tags and elements
    - Serves as the structure of a webpage
  - W3C, World Wide Web Consortium (https://www.w3.org/Consortium/)
    - an international community of member organizations, staff and the public that works together to define and develop web standards
    - One Web vision
  - HTML Tags
    - Tags separate normal text from HTML code.
    - Tags are not visible in the browser, they tell the browser what kind of content is being displayed.
    - Tags describe different document content
    - **Tags are chosen based on WHAT the content is, not HOW it looks**\
    - Tag Syntax
      - Tags start with a '<' and end with a '>'
        - `<p>` (paragraph tag)
        - `<h1>` (heading tag)
      - Tags come in pairs or are self-closing:
        - `<p>`This is a paragraph and has a start and end tag.`</p>`
        - `<img src="image.jpg" />` This is an image tag, it does not have a start and end tag. It self closes before the closing bracket with a forward slash.
    - HTML Elements
      - The words 'tag' and 'element' are often used interchangeably. However, they are not the same thing.
      - Elements are made up of tags and the content they are describing.
        - `<p>`This is a paragraph with start and end tags. The tags and the content between them make up an HTML element.`</p>`
