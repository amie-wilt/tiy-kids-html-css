## Week 1
  - What is HTML?
    - **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage
    - Made up of tags and elements
    - Serves as the structure of a webpage
  - W3C, World Wide Web Consortium (https://www.w3.org/Consortium/)
    - an international community of member organizations, staff and the public that works together to define and develop web standards
    - One Web vision
  - HTML Tags
    - Tags separate normal text from HTML code.
    - Tags are not visible in the browser, they tell the browser what kind of content is being displayed.
    - Tags describe different document content
    - **Tags are chosen based on WHAT the content is, not HOW it looks**
    - Tag Syntax
      - Tags start with a '<' and end with a '>'
        - `<p>` (paragraph tag)
        - `<h1>` (heading tag)
      - Tags come in pairs or are self-closing:
        - `<p>`This is a paragraph and has a start and end tag.`</p>`
        - `<img src="image.jpg" />` This is an image tag, it does not have a start and end tag. It self closes before the closing bracket with a forward slash.
    - HTML Elements
      - The words 'tag' and 'element' are often used interchangeably. However, they are not the same thing.
      - Elements are made up of tags and the content they are describing.
        - `<p>`This is a paragraph with start and end tags. The tags and the content between them make up an HTML element.`</p>`

## Week 2
  - What is CSS?
    - CSS stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets
    - Where HTML is the **structure** of a webpage, CSS is the **layout** of a webpage.
    - HTML was never intended to be responsible for the formatting of a webpage.
    - The W3C created CSS to remove the styling from the HTML markup.
    - Styles can be managed in one CSS file rather than in numerous HTML files.
  - CSS Syntax
    - CSS consists of a selector and a declaration block.
    - A selector points to the HTML element that receives the styling.
    - The declaration block opens and closes with curly brackets and contain declarations.
    - A declaration is made up of a property and a value.
  - CSS Selectors
    - Element Selector
      - Selects elements based on the elements name
      - The element selector of an HTML paragraph (`<p>`) is **p**
    - ID Selector
      - Selects elements based on the ID attribute of an element
      - IDs are unique to one element and elements may only have one ID
      - They are written with a hash symbol (#)
      - HTML: `<p id="paragraph1">`
      - CSS: #paragraph1
    - Class Selector
      - Selects elements based on their class attribute
      - Classes can be used on multiple elements
      - They are written with a period (.)
      - HTML: `<p class="paragraph">`
      - CSS: .paragraph
      
## Week 3
  - The CSS **Display** Property
    - Most important CSS property for displaying layout.
    - Every HTML element has a default display property, most of which are block or inline.
      - Block-level elements
        - Always start on a new line
        - Take up the full available width
        - `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<header>`
      - Inline elements
        - Sit inline with the natural flow and therefore do not start on a new line
        - Only take up the necessary width
        - Do not respect height and width properties
        - Accept margin and padding properties but only respond to them horizontally, not vertically
        - `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`
      - Inline-block elements
        - Are similar to inline elements in that they sit inline with the natural flow
        - Take on block-level characteristics in that they respect the width, height, margin and padding properties
      - display: none;
        - Can you guess what that does?
        
## Week 4
  - The CSS **Position** Property
    - Manipulates the location of an HTML element
      - Static: the default position for all HTML elements
      - Relative
      - Absolute
      - Fixed
    - Static
      - The default position for all HTML elements
      - A static element sticks to the normal page flow
      - The left, right, top and bottom properties have **no effect** on static elements
    - Relative
      - Relative elements also stick to the normal page flow
      - However, they **are affected** by the left, right, top and bottom properties
      - These properties move the element relative to its **original position**
    - Absolute
      - When an element has a position of absolute, it is **removed from the natural flow of the page**
      - Other elements will behave as though it is not there
      - Absolute elements are positioned **relative to their closest positioned parent**
      - If there is no positioned parent, they are positioned **relative to the document body**
    - Fixed
      - A fixed element is **removed from the natural flow of the page** as absolutely-positioned elements are
      - However, they are always **positioned relative to the document body**, regardless of any positioned parents
      - Fixed elements are unaffected by scrolling

## Week 5
  - Flexbox (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
    - An efficient way to align and distribute space amongst items in a container, even when their size is unknown.
    - There are other layout techniques, however this is the newest and best option.
    - Flex Container
      - The parent container
      - Takes the display property with a value of **flex**
      - There are other properties it can take, however this property must be declared to use flexbox.
        - `flex-direction`
        - `flex-wrap`
        - `flex-flow`
        - `justify-content`
        - `align-items`
    - Flex Items
      - The children of the parent container
      - When `display: flex` is declared on a parent container, the **direct children** of that container become flex items.
      - The **flex items** can take properties as well.
        - `order`
        - `flex-grow`
        - `flex-shrink`
  - Colors
    - Hexadecimal notation (Hex)
      - Takes a value of a mix of 6 numbers and characters in the form of `##RRGGBB`
      - RR = red, GG = green, BB = blue
      - Values are between 00 (the lowest) and FF (the highest)
      - Red: `#FF0000`
      - Green: `#00FF00`
      - Blue: `#0000FF`
    - RGB (**R**ed, **G**reen, **B**lue)
      - There are 3 different values, one for **red**, **green**, and **blue**
      - The values are between 0 (the lowest value) and 255 (the highest value)
      - Red: `rgb(255, 0, 0)`
      - Green: `rgb(0, 255, 0)`
      - Blue: `rgb(0, 0, 255)`
